# Epidemiology_and_Ecology_in_R

This repository contains RMarkdown files for the "[Ecology and Epidemiology in R](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/topc/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/Pages/default.aspx)" materials as prepared by Drs. Garrett, Esker and Sparks in 2007 and 2008 for the American Phytopathological Societies *Plant Health Instructor*.

These files have been created to assist in the updating of the existing materials as at the time when the original versions were created, RMarkdown (and RStudio) did not exist so they were written in HTML and shared with APS in this file format.

The resulting HTML files in some cases are not true to the original because the citations include the references that have since been accepted and published in the *Plant Health Instructor*.
